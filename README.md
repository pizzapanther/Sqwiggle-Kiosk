# Sqwiggle Kiosk

A Chrome App for making Sqwiggle Kiosks around your office.

## The Concept
[Sqwiggle](https://www.sqwiggle.com/) is a video conferencing tool for remote teams. The main difference between Sqwiggle and other video conference tools is that you keep it on all day so that you get the effect of working in the same office as your teammates.

This is great, however; it is cumbersome if you have some people that work in an office together and some team members that work remotely.  The teams members in the office often don't want to individually log into the Sqwiggle service.

To solve this problem, I created a simple app that you can setup on a public TV or monitor in your office and log into Sqwiggle with.  This lets your remote teammates participate in your office without everyone having to log into Sqwiggle. This could also be used to connect two or more offices or remote conference rooms. The app is extremely easy to use and touch friendly so you can set it up like a "kiosk" that any one can use very quickly.

## Setup

1. Install the app at: 
2. Click the "Change Login Info" button and fill out the info. If you don't know what your Room Slug is, login into Sqwiggle. Once in a chat room you will see a URL like: https://app.sqwiggle.com/room-slug. Use the value at the end of the URL.
3. Click "Save & Login"

When you restart the app, your login info is saved and you can just login.

**Security Note:** The login info is never displayed anywhere but for security since this will be a public video terminal, you probably don't want to stay logged in with an admin account.

**Kiosk Mode for Chromebook/Chromeboxes:** https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/3134673?hl=en

Once setup as a kiosk, Sqwiggle Kiosk will autostart.

## Hardware

Anything with a desktop version of Chrome and a web cam should suffice, however; I have some recommendations.

* Microphone: Since this will be in a public setting with possibly multiple speakers use an omni-directional microphone.
* Web Cam: The [Logitech BCC950](http://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/conferencecam?crid=1545) is great for conference situations and has an omni-directional microphone built in. *I need to test on Chrome OS still, but it definitely works with a Mac or PC*
* Computer: For a cheap computer check out the [Asus Chromebox](http://promos.asus.com/us/chrome-os/chromebox/). This app runs great on Chrome OS and paired with a good web cam and microphone, this is a cheap, effective way to make a Sqwiggle Kiosk.
